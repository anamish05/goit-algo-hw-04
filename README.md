Based on the test of the functions to sort 3 datasets, it was observed that:
for each random dataset of different size sorted() function, which uses timsort algoritm,
works the best, compared to insertion sort and merge sort,
based on the time of the operations completion.
This leads to the conclusion that timsort method is the most efficient
among these 3 methods of sorting.
